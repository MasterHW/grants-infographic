The project's primary goal is to foster a conducive environment where DAO enthusiasts and builders can connect across cultures, learn from each other, and cultivate high-trust relationships. 
\n\n
While a new project that is only six months old, xBound has already made strides in its mission, as evidenced by the successful completion of a pilot event, SeoulBound. This event brought together 60 participants and led to the emergence of five tangible projects, which are currently being developed to support the web3 ecosystem. 
\n\n
A key aspect of xBound's strategy is the development of a playbook to enable running a series of regional events across Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America. This tool is designed to shift the focus towards local perspectives and amplify voices that are often underrepresented in the DAO space. The ultimate goal is to encourage more local communities to share their wisdom and knowledge and actively engage with each other.
